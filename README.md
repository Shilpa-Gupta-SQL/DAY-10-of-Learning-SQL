⭐ What I Learned

1. What Subqueries Are ->
* A subquery is an inner query whose result is used by an outer query. 
* Useful for filtering, comparing values, and breaking complex logic into smaller steps.

2. Types of Subqueries ->
* Single-row subqueries – return one value (e.g., average salary). 
* Multi-row subqueries – return multiple values (e.g., list of departments). 
* Correlated subqueries – inner query depends on each row of the outer query. 
* Non-correlated subqueries – inner query runs independently.

⭐ Where Subqueries Are Used ->
* In the WHERE clause for filtering, 
* In the SELECT clause for calculations, 
* In the FROM clause as a temporary table (subquery table)
